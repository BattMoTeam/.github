# BattMo

BattMo (Battery Model) is an open sourced battery cell simulation package written in Julia and MATLAB. Our mission is to accelerate battery cell development by providing accessible and easy to use tools for researchers, industry, and educational purposes. The initial development features a pseudo X-dimensional (PXD) framework for the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model of lithium-ion battery cells. However, the development plan for BattMo includes extensions to other battery chemistries (e.g. metal-air) and eventually hydrogen systems (i.e. electrolyzers and fuel cells).

BattMo can be utilized from several interfaces:

- MATLAB - [BattMo](https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMo)
- Julia - [BattMo.jl](https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMo.jl)
- Python - [PyBattMo](https://github.com/BattMoTeam/PyBattMo)
- Web application - [BattMoApp](https://app.batterymodel.com/)
